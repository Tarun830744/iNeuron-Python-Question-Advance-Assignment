    "\n",
    "Ans = **\\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_** is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an AttributeError of it fails to find an attribute of a class. **\\_\\_getattr\\_\\_** is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by **\\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_**, but for this **\\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_** and **\\_\\_getattr\\_\\_** both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, **\\_\\_getattr\\_\\_** returns a default value. So key difference is that **\\_\\_getattr\\_\\_** is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class."
